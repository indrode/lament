## Beautiful Sky

Cutting straight to the chase, this is my Mac OS X menu bar as of lately:

You will notice several things. Or rather, you will notice the absence of things. Let's take a look at what is actually there. On the very top right of the menu bar, the black area is a rounded screen corner, which I enabled using [Displaperture](http://manytricks.com/displaperture/). _This tool brings back rounded screen corners to Mac OS X 10.5 and newer._ But that's not really part of the menu bar.

On the actual menu bar, most of the time there are just two items visible. First, using Shaun Inman's [Day-O](http://www.shauninman.com/archive/2011/10/20/day_o_mac_menu_bar_clock), the current time is displayed in H:mm format. _Day-O is a simple menu bar clock replacement that includes a calendar._ It turned out that the time is the only item that I always need to have in sight.

The second item is the wonderful [Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com), which organizes and hides the rest of my menu bar apps. I could have even removed that little star and just used a shortcut (⌥ + ⌘ + b) to reveal my other icons, but I liked having the option to click. This is how it looks like when I do reveal the icons:

Unsurprisingly, I like to hide all these icons most of the time. _Bartender allows you to get that tidy, clean looking menu bar and I would urge everyone to try it out, especially when using a 13" Macbook Air like me._

One of Bartender's options is to have app icons appear when they become active. For example, this is how it looks when [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) is syncing files:

That is all.
