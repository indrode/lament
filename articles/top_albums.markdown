Retrieved from my [last.fm account](http://www.last.fm/user/zenpunch/charts?subtype=albums), here is the current (as of December 16, 2012) *list of my top-ranked albums according to the number of tracks played*. This is **not** a list of my all-times favorites, but all of these would rank pretty highly, I guess.

## [10. The Sound - Jeopardy (1980)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy_%28album%29)

The debut album of the rather short-lived **The Sound**, one of the greatest bands that ever existed.

___

## [9. The Church - Starfish (1988)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starfish_%28album%29)

**The Church** has made a lot of really good music. This album is still my favorite of theirs.

___

## [8. The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Axis: Bold as Love (1967)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_Bold_As_Love)

No, I don't think this album requires any more words. It's definitely up there in my all-time Top-5.

___

## [7. Pixies - Doolittle (1989)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doolittle_%28album%29)

Just good music by one of the best bands in this planet's music history.

___

## [6. David Bowie - Diamond Dogs (1974)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_Dogs)

Very well executed concept album, but displaying just one of **David Bowie**'s many facets worth looking into.

___

## [5. The Cure - The Head on the Door (1985)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Head_on_the_Door)

Not in my personal Top-5 of albums by **The Cure** alone, but in my overall Top-5 of listenings. How does that work, you ask? Must be the inclusion of track number five, **Push**.

___

## [4. Captain Beyond - Captain Beyond (1972)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Beyond_%28album%29)

They just don't make music like this anymore. Pure perfection.

___

## [3. The Cure - Seventeen Seconds (1980)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventeen_Seconds)

My favorite album by **The Cure**. Dark, melancholic, and utterly depressing. I listen to this from start to finish. Every second is just perfect.

___

## [2. Dream City Film Club - Dream City Film Club (1997)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_City_Film_Club)

Unbeknownst to the majority, this short-lived band may have just been too good for the zeitgeist of their existence (1995-1999).

___

<img src="http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/500/57756113/Bossanova+PNG.png" class="left-wrap album-cover-small" />

## [1. Pixies - Bossanova (1990)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bossanova)

I don't know if this would make it into my hypothetical Top-5 all-time favorite albums. I can't even say whether this is my favorite of the **Pixies**. I can say however, that this is a true masterpiece.
___

That is all.
